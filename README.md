# Lazy-Work-Station-Setup
Create profiles that set up your desktop for work every morning.... why do it yourself? 

to get just the program:
Lazy-Work-Station-Setup -> DesktopWorkSetup -> DesktopWorkSetup -> bin -> Debug -> DesktopWorkSetup

NO login information is ever saved or stored.
All profiles are saved in your MyDocuments folder under "Desktop Work Setup" folder.

Please report any issues and I'll try to get them fixed.

the ONLY planned add on feature will be adding a custume timer to the individual applications allowed start up time.
